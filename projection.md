*A Commentary on the First Book of Euclid's *Elements**

> We must therefore posit the soul as the generatrix of the mathematical forms and ideas. And if we say that the sould produces them by having their patterns in her own essence and that these offspring are the projections of forms previously existing in her, we shall be in agreement with Plato and shall have found the truth with regard to mathematcal being. (*Euclid Commentary*, *Prologue: Part One*, Chapter VI, 13, Glenn R. Morrow, translation)

Intial occurence of *projection* (προβολαι) in the *Euclid Commentary*. The extended treatment of this topic occurs at 51-6.

This is a generalization of a *Meno*-style epistemology of geometry.
